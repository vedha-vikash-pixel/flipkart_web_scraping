# flipkart_web_scraping
The python script is gonna get you all the details of a particular product in flipkart loaded into a excel sheet.

There are certain libraries that this scrip makes use of namely so make sure you have these libraries in your environment : 
openpyxl

lxml

selenium

pandas

beautifulsoup4

requests

tkinter


you can install these libraries using pip :
#pip install openpyxl

#pip install lxml

#pip install selenium

#pip install pandas

#pip install beautifulsoup4

#pip install requests

#pip install tkinter

In this case I have used the chrome webbrowser to automate the process , so make sure you download the correct version of chromedriver depending upon your chrome version in this link - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads .keep the extracted chromedriver in the same folder as the python script.

The results are going to be loaded into an excel file so make sure you also have a empty excel file named product_listing created and kept in the same folder.
