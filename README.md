# flipkart_web_scraping
The python script is gonna get you all the details of a particular product in flipkart loaded into a excel sheet.

There are certain libraries that this scrip makes use of namely so make sure you have these libraries in your environment : 
openpyxl

lxml

selenium

pandas

beautifulsoup4

requests

tkinter


you can install these libraries using pip :
#pip install openpyxl

#pip install lxml

#pip install selenium

#pip install pandas

#pip install beautifulsoup4

#pip install requests

#pip install tkinter

In this case I have used the chrome webbrowser to automate the process , i already have the chromedriver for chromebrowser Version 90.0.4430.212 added in this repository ,if you have a different chrome browser version make sure you download the correct version of chromedriver depending upon your chrome version in this link - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads .keep the extracted chromedriver in the same folder as the python script.

I already added the empty excel file with the file name product_listing in this repository which is where the output is going to be loaded.
